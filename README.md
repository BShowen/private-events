Things I need to  fix

<!-- 1) any user can view an event and invite people. only event hosts should be able to invite people.  -->

<!-- 2) creating a new event form doesnt have a date field.  -->

3) Dont allow events to be created in the past. 

3) When a user accepts an invite he needs to be added to the events "coming" list. 

4) an events show page should deisplay the list of invited userd and a list of users who have accepted the invite. 

5) I want to also display a list of users who have declined to go to the event. Maybe add a column to the invite (delined:boolean) that can be used for this logic. 

6) When an event has passed you should not be able to invite anyone to it. 

7) I need to add flash alerts.
